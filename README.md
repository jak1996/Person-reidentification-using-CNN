# Person-reidentification-using-CNN
This project was developed as final thesis for my bachelor degree at university of Pavia
The goal was comparing the performances of different architectures of CNN on 3 different dataset for person reidentification.
The tested architectures are vgg16, resnet and inception v3. The trainings were based on transfer learning. I tested different configurations: fine tuning just the last layer, fine tuning the entire network and fine tuning using data augmentation techniques.
The datasets used are:
- market-1501 
- Duke MTMC-ReID 
- MSMT 17
this were the results:
